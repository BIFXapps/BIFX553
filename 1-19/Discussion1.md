BIFX 553 Discussion 1: January 19, 2017
=======================================

Pretest
-------

1) What is a p-value?

2) Write a short R script to add all numbers from 1 to 100 using a for loop.

3) Repeat problem 2 using only one line of code (i.e. without using a for loop).

4) Given the data.frame, *dat*, with the variables {*x1*, *x2*, *x3*, *y*}, write the R command to create a linear model for *y* using *x1*, *x2* and *x3* as predictors.

5) Write an R command to plot the relationship between *x1* and *y*.

6) Given the relationship between *x1* and *y* in this figure, update the R command in question 4 with a more appropriate model.

7) A collaborator presents a data analysis to you. The p-value they give you is p = 0.012. Is this statistically significant?

8) After discussing the results further, you discover that this p-value represents just one of 20 tests performed in the analysis.
  - What is the Bonferroni threshold for significance if you want the family-wise error rate to be Î± = 0.05?
  - Is the result statistically significant?
  
9) What assumptions are made in a simple linear regression?
  - What R command(s) can you use to get a quick look at whether those assumptions have been violated?

10) Explain the relationship between confidence intervals and p-values.
  - Why are confidence intervals more useful than p-values?

Discussion of R programming basics
----------------------------------

- What data types does R have?
- What are the standard data structures in R?
