Welcome to BIFX 553
===================

Syllabus
--------

### Course description

After learning basic data science skills in Bioinformatics Applications
I, students will gain a deeper understanding of statistics and machine
learning. A deeper understanding will be gained of what can go wrong in
data analyses, and principles of reproducible research will be
emphasized. Analyses will be primarily performed in R, and data science
skills will continue to be developed.

-   Instructor: Randall Johnson, PhD
-   Office Hours: In-person office hours will be held Thursdays
    immediately after class.
-   Prerequisites: BIFX 552
-   Textbook: [Data Analysis for the Life
    Sciences](https://leanpub.com/dataanalysisforthelifesciences)
-   Communications: All course communications will be posted on
    Blackboard. In order to receive timely notifications, it is
    recommended that you do one or more of the following:
    -   Check Blackboard often
    -   Set your Blackboard email notifications to alert you when
        something is posted
    -   Download the phone app and enable push notifications (this may
        not be the best option this term, as the app was just released
        and seems to be a little limited).

### Learning Objectives

On completion of this course, students should be comfortable with the
following:

-   Basic R programming
-   R package management
-   Linear Regression
-   Logistic Regression
-   Some familiarity with other machine learning techniques

### Homework

In addition to weekly reading assignments, Blackboard modules containing
instructional vignettes will need to be viewed. These modules will be
followed by a short quiz to guage class understanding prior to class.
Students will be given a score for each quiz, but only participation
will be tracked for the purpose of grading (i.e. if you complete both
the module and the quiz, full points will be awarded for grading
purposes).

### Grading

Grades will be based on completion of homework, in-class participation,
and two exams.

-   Homework - 30%
-   In-class participation - 30%
-   Mid-term - 20%
-   Final exam - 20%

### Weather

In the event of severe weather resulting in the closure of Hood College
and the cancellation of a regularly scheduled class, the material from
the missed class will be posted on blackboard, and a live chat session
will be held to work through material and answer questions.

### Tentative Schedule

Reading assignments are from Data Analysis for the Life Sciences unless
otherwise specified, and they should be read *prior* to class. More
details on reading assignments will be given on
[Blackboard](https://hood.blackboard.com/).
